Steps to Create a Local Mesh Network
Choose Compatible Hardware:

Select WiFi routers and repeaters that support mesh networking or can be configured for ad-hoc mode. Many modern routers support mesh networking out of the box.
Configure Routers and Repeaters:

Set up the routers and repeaters to create a local network. Ensure they are configured to operate on the same channel and SSID for seamless connectivity.
Disable DHCP on all routers except one, which will act as the main DHCP server to assign IP addresses within the network.
Create a Local Chat Server:

Choose a lightweight chat server software that can run on a local server or even a Raspberry Pi connected to one of the routers. Some options include:
XMPP (Jabber): Protocol with implementations like Prosody or Openfire.
Matrix: A more modern decentralized protocol that supports both text and multimedia messages.
Install and configure the chat server to listen for connections within the local network.
Develop or Use Existing Chat Clients:

Develop a chat client application or use existing apps that support the protocol used by your chat server.
Ensure the chat clients are configured to connect to the local server IP address.
Connect Devices to the Network:

Have users connect their devices to the WiFi network created by the routers and repeaters.
Ensure their chat applications are configured to connect to the local server.
Considerations
Range and Coverage:

Ensure that the routers and repeaters are placed strategically to provide adequate coverage and minimize dead zones.
Security:

Implement security measures such as WPA2/WPA3 encryption on the WiFi network and require authentication for accessing the chat server.
Scalability:

Consider the number of devices and the expected traffic load. You may need to optimize or add more nodes to handle more users.
Offline Operation:

Since the network is local, all services must be available within the network, including DNS and chat services.
Redundancy and Fault Tolerance:

In larger networks, implement redundancy to ensure the network remains operational if one or more nodes fail.
Practical Use Cases
Events and Conferences:

A local network can be set up at events to allow attendees to communicate without relying on cellular networks or internet access.
Remote Locations:

Useful in areas with limited or no internet access, such as rural areas or research stations.
Creating such a network is a feasible project and can be a great way to provide local communication capabilities without relying on external infrastructure.
